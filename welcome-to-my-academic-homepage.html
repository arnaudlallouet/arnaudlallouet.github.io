                    <p>
                        Welcome to my personal academic homepage! This inaugural post introduces the purpose 
                        of this blog and what you can expect to find here. I'll be sharing insights on AI research, 
                        technology trends, and reflections on academic life.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As a researcher in artificial intelligence with a focus on constraint programming and 
                        combinatorial optimization, I've created this space to share my thoughts on the evolving 
                        landscape of AI research. This blog will serve as a platform to discuss:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Research Insights:</strong> Reflections on my work in constraint programming, 
                        SAT solving, and combinatorial optimization</li>
                        <li><strong>Technology Trends:</strong> Observations on emerging AI techniques and their 
                        applications in real-world problems</li>
                        <li><strong>Academic Life:</strong> Thoughts on research methodology, collaboration, 
                        and the academic publishing process</li>
                        <li><strong>Conference Updates:</strong> Reports from conferences like AAAI, CP, ICTAI, 
                        and CPAIOR where I present my research</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        My research focuses on bridging theoretical advances in constraint satisfaction with 
                        practical applications in logistics, scheduling, and optimization. Through this blog, 
                        I hope to make these complex topics more accessible and share the excitement of 
                        discovering new solutions to challenging problems.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I also plan to discuss the broader implications of AI research, including how 
                        constraint programming and optimization techniques are being integrated with 
                        machine learning approaches to solve increasingly complex real-world problems.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Whether you're a fellow researcher, a student interested in AI, or someone curious 
                        about the practical applications of constraint programming, I hope you'll find 
                        something valuable here. I encourage you to engage with the content through 
                        comments and discussions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to sharing this journey of exploration 
                        and discovery with you!
                    </p>
